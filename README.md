## Summary
This is a rpg game set at the end of the sengoku ere japan about a shinobi on a quest to retrieve his master from the people who took him killing anyone and anything that stands in his way. Gameplay introduces posture as well as a health bar the posture bar can be considered another health bar that works in the opposite way where if it's full and you block or get hit you'll be opened up to an instant kill. You can increase the damage to the enemies posture by deflecting an attack instead of blocking, it introduces an extra difficulty to the game where blocking repeatedly can result in your death and this mechanic is applied to every enemy and yourself. Another mechanic is the shinobi prostetic which is pretty much just random tools that cause certain things to happen from scaring enemies, catching people on fire, using a grappling hook and throwing a shuriken allowing multiple ways to dealing with enemies fighting head-on which will more than likely result in death if outnumbered or stealth which allows to instantly kill enemies unaware of you. The game has multiple endings which all but two are difficult to actually attain having to go almost completely out of the way of the main quest which id mildly annoying but if you meet the requirements to get the ending at the end of the final boss fight you can choose which ending you get besides the betrayel ending which you can get pretty early compared to the rest.

## Final Thoughts
The game is generally much more difficult than previous From Software games Bloodborne and Dark Souls but just like those games it gets generally easier the more you memorize the enemy and react to the attack patterns
