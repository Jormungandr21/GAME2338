**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ One rule i didn't realize was for every balloon you didn't pop you lost a life so if there was a blue balloon which turns 
into a red balloon when popped but you didn't pop it, it would cost two lives

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Since it's a web browser game you could right click on it and then move the cursor away and it would lock into whatever it was 
you were doing. Example there's a fast forward option that you have to hold but by doing the above you could just click once and let go

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ Yes

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Maybe, each round on each level seems perfect but the overall game if you're playing it for free where you 
can't save progress or unlocks meens you have to play it in one sitting and that makes it seem long

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Alot of fun easily was able to play this game for 2 hours as a side game

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Besides the aformentioned bug where you can hold the fast forward button without holding it but i think thats a web broswer 
bug and not a bug by the game itself
