## Summary
This game is about the main characters of Persona 4 getting ready for a festivel in which they will be dancing but as it gets started it turns out people are going missing and while they try to figure out why it's happening and try to rescue the missing people they learn the enemies they were previously fighting now can only be beaten by expressing your feelings through dance. The gameplay is classic rhythm game where the buttons on the controller are pressed in correspondence with the prompts on screen, played against the songs of the main game which were not only amazing to listen to in the context of the game but pretty amazing without it. All the while the game keeps to the roots of the main game losing the rpg elements but keeping the story that guided you through Persona 4 which is learning about the truth. It has two different modes story mode and freeplay mode, story mode has two difficulties easy or normal pretty much designed to help you learn the game and get you the story while freeplay mode is where you can get harder difficulties and modify the songs themselves to have more notes to press or in reverse order which allows for people to play the same songs over and over but with different variations.

## Final Thoughts
This game had a respecteble story that is a legitimately good sequel and if it got rid of the dancing and the explanation around the dancing it could have been a direct sequel rpg. The amount of songs originally in the game are also remixed allowing for a pretty decent amount of songs to play through and while the game is pretty good by itself just the freeplay mode I don't see why you'd get a this game if you weren't a fan of or at least played persona 4 and liked the music.
