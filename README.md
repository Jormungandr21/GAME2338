> Not really there were somethings i didn't like but beside that everything worked together nicely

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> It was pretty balanced enemies not too difficult with the tools given

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> Playing it no stages felt too long or too short

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> In the sense of dead island originally could let you attack enemies from different angles yes, but it also didn't feel like a dead island game, could've been any zombie arcade game

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> Tonnes of fun

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
