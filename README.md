> All the rules were clear and easy to understand

> During the final boss fight is when it gets wierd the final boss is supposed to take awhile and not be a regular mob, but if you use a team skill turret it will kill the boss in about a couple seconds triggering quicktime events at whatever threshold and then go into the next one. If it was remove the boss fight is really hard compared to the rest of the game

> Not really the game itself isn't that hard but some of bosses seem a little too hard for the type of game, ofcourse that's only if you don't use CERTAIN team skills like the turret which does way too much damage

> Yes for a side scroller it did not take too long at all

> Yes really kept up with the show with the characters combat and the fusions otherwise none as team skills

> Yes

> I could get characters to freeze in place if they got hit with a debilitating status effect and didn't recover before the boss fight ended. Example one character being frozen at the end of a fight and then afterwards the character would still be frozen during the end boss cutscene
