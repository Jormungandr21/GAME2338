## Summary
This game is about a little kid who wakes up in the underground world of monsters and begins a long arduous journey to get back to the surface. It's core mechanic is the fact that battles which are random encounters can be resolved without using the attack option example being you see a monster it tries to attack you and on your turn you talk to it and you get 3 options calling it Fat Ugly or Pretty and if you call it pretty it'll blush and run away thus awarding you gold for succesfly navigating the encounter but ofcourse since you didn't actually kill anything you don't get XP. The entire game can be played an beaten without killing a single enemy or leveling up and with the multiple endings of the games, the true ending being locked behind Beating the game once and then NOT killing anything on the second run and a challenging boss fight you'd think the developer was trying to say the nice way isn't the easy way but the alternate path of the game killing EVERY single monster you see, forcing all random encounters until you get the message BUT NO ONE CAME, what is known as the GENOCIDE route because you slaughter everything nets you not the TRUE FINAL BOSS but the ULTIMATE BOSS a fun loving skeleton who decides you are the reincarnation of evil and must be ahnilated aslo shows playing the game like a classic rpg and killing everything isn't any easier. Combat is primarily like a bullet hell game where the main players soul is dodging attacks from multiple directions and speeds avoiding getting hit and when you do happen to attack it's a time based attack and the damage is based on how close to the middle you can get. The game has fun characters and a suprisingly interesting story about how humanity forced the monsters to live underground and the peaceful king is just trying to release his people from there eternal imprisonment the only way he can by taking human souls pretty much blurring the original rpg mentality of monsters=evil player=good.

## Final Thoughts
Definately a fun game going around being a normal rpg player killing enemies you find, sparing eveyrone for the sake that everyones alive and no one wants to die or mercilessly slaughtering the entire population for the sole sake and seeing what will happen if you do
