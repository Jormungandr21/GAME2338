## Summary
This game is about a little spirit ori trying to restore a withered forest. The game is very interesting with good art and music, combat is pretty basic for a side scrolling 2d platformer multiple types of enemies some needing unique skills or the enviroment to kill them and some even effecting the enviroment so nothing really special or spectacular there, but for some strange reason four years after the initial release of this game it still crashes on startup for me taking about 5 min to actually play the game whittling my patience and then when i can actually start the game i can't figure out where i'm going or what i'm supposed to do which is something most platformers suffer from leaving me with the only option of starting over or looking it up online and i usually just start over so even now still haven't beaten this game and probably never will

## Final Thoughts
Game is nice and suprisingly buggy don't know why it crashes on startup fifty percent of the time i only know it aggravates me and if the enemies were more interesting or the game more blatant with directions it wouldn't have mattered that i can't start it up on the first try
