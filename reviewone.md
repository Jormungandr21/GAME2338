## Summary
Third game in the series of shantae games a direct continuation of the second where the main character loses her powers and has a depowered heroine trying to save the continent without magic and instead leaning on the power of her nemesis' pirate weapons to combat the forces of evil. A normal platformer with multiple stages with multiple screens to traverse through to complete said stage with collectibles and side mission scattered about that can either be completed then or at a later date with a new weapon that either allows gliding, double jumping or sprint jumping. Normaly the Shantae games main gimmick is shantae's ability to transform into different animals with different abilities to complete stages and get new items but since she lost her magic it's supplimented with new weapons that allow acces to different areas a change to the core of the series which allows for slightly different gameplay but only slightly since at it's core it's still the same go to one area beat the enemies and then realize you can't get to one area and remember to comeback later.

## Final Thoughts
In general i'm not a fan of platformers because i'm not good at remembering to comeback to an area i was already in for something i don't need and it only makes me madder when i'm required to go back to complete an area which this game does, makes it inconvinient to stop playing the game for a week and then not realize where i was going it's a fun game but not really that much different then the first and second one which was what i was expecting
