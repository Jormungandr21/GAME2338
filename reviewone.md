## Summary
This game is about a man named vincent as he struggles through life as the women he's been dating decides she wants more another women comes into the fray and the stress from everything causes vincent to have wierd dreams where he's climbing a tower made of boxes avoiding whatever nightmares is chasing him. Essentially a push block puzzle where pushing blocks causes blocks to attach to another block or destabalize the layer your on all the while different blocks have traps on them like spikes when you step on them or blocks that are only there for a few steps and eventually having to deal with other people in the form of sheep who are also trying to escape and will do anything to survive even if it means killing you. And in the same vein you can also play this game two player versus mode where you and a friend play as two sheep and compete to reach the end of the nightmare or more likely kill the other person because it's easier. The other side is the story you spend your free time at a bar hanging out with your friends and helping out seemingly random poeple with there problems eventually while avoiding your own and the more you get to know these people eventually you learn that they are the sheep you see right before your nightmare begins and by talking to them in the bar to overcome there problems they don't get killed by them during the nightmares. And dependent on your choices on which girl to choose you can get either main girl ending good bad neutral or other girl ending good bad neutral or bad neutral ending or good neutral ending.

## Final Thoughts
So in the end the gameplay is talk with people and help them through there problems so they can better themselves and pushing differemt types of blocks around to either save yourself or kill others and thats pretty much the entire gameplay aspect of this game. The multiple endings is a nice touch adds some replayability in the sense that you can change the ending but it's also the only downside to the game, to get all the endings you need to play through the game at least three times because if you don't spend 80% of your time with one girl you can't get there good ending and if your not perfectly down' the middle you can't get the good neutral ending, bad endings need 20% or less so that is the only change to the game because the puzzles do have an optimal way to go through them and after two playthroughs you'll just solve it the same way becuase it's the best way and there is no reason to talk to people if you're not gonna help them so you may as well skip that and you may as well skip the puzzles and if you do that it's pick a girl alot and then see the ending.
